            As a programmer, naturally this is where most of my work takes place. Since I work in web development, I am mostly familiar with 
            JavaScript and some of its popular libraries. I also worked with PHP and some Content Management Systems like WordPress, which 
            rely on it. I also think it's important to not forget about the very fundamentals of web dev, 
            so regularyly brushing up on HTML and CSS knwoledge
            and keeping up to date is crucial. 
            Besides it being my day job, coding is also just a fun and rewarding activity for me, that's one of the reasons I created this site.

            Even if I did not ending up working in a field directly related to my studies (arts, music and media), I am glad I chose 
            and finished it successfully. Besides learning some valuable meta skills like organizing my time and gaining 
            an understanding of a previously 
            unknown field, I really enjoyed being surrounded by like minded people and to deepen my knowledge in the respective 
            topics.
            Later, when I took on developing software, I even noticed some similarities in the way my brain works 
            when putting together some 
            code and analzing or arranging music.

            I rarely browse through regular tv programs but I do enjoy a good movie or a great series. I am also a big fan of learning
            about new things by watching interesting channels on youtube. To create games with JavaScript 
            <a href="https://youtube.com/@jslegenddev" target="_blank">JSLegendDev</a> is an excellent resource. It's how I learned 
            to use Kaplay to create this website :).

            Rest is important, so I try to get enough of it every night. Sometimes the solution to a problem presents itself in the
            moments I'm most relaxed. You can probably relate :)
            I often keep some notebooks next to my bed, so these ideas don't get lost, as they unfortunately do so often.
