  pc: `As a programmer, naturally this is where most of my work takes place. Since I work in web development, I am mostly familiar with 
        JavaScript and some of its popular libraries and I also worked with PHP and some Content Management Systems like WordPress, which 
        rely on it. I also think it's important to never neglect the basic in web dev, so regularyly brushing up on my HTML and CSS knwoledge
        and keeping up to date is crucial. 
        Besides it being my day job coding is just a fun and rewarding activity, that's one of the reasons I created this site. 
        Here you can checkout my <a href="https://github.com/lenakujath" target="_blank">Github</a>, if you want to browse through some
        of my code!`,
  desk: `Even if I did not ending up working in a field directly related to my studies (arts, music and media), I am glad I chose 
                    and finished it successfully. Besides learning some valuable meta skills like organizing my time and gaining an understanding of a previously 
                    unknown field, I really enjoyed being surrounded by like minded people and to deepen my knowledge in the respective topics.
                    Later, when I took on developing software, I even noticed some similarities in the way my brain works when putting together some 
                    code and analzing or arranging music.`,
  "sofa": `After a full day I like to relax on the sofa and maybe listen to music, play my guitar or watch a good movie.`,
  tv: `I rarely browse through regular tv but I do enjoy a good movie or a great series. I am also a big fan of learning
        about new things by watching some cool channels on youtube. To create games with JavaScript 
        <a href="https://youtube.com/@jslegenddev" target="_blank">JSLegendDev</a> is an excellent resource. It's how I learned 
        how to use Kaplay to create this website :).`,
  bed: `Rest is important, so I try to get enough of it every night. Sometimes the solution to a problem presents itself in the
        moments I'm most relaxed. I think lots of people can relate.
         I often keep some notebooks next to my bed, so these ideas don't get lost again.`,
  bag: `It's important to always be prepared, so I keep my bag ready and packed!`,
  fridge: `I love as much to eat as the next person so it's important to me to have my fridge filled with ingredients to prepare
            a delious meal. I also enjoy eating it a lot to eat out with friends and family.`,
  guestbed: `I love being surrounded by my friends and to have them over. There is always a place for them to stay in my flat.`,

  garden: `Programming and computers are nice, but it's also important to get some fresh air. I am a big fan of just strolling around 
            outside, be it in the city or in nature.`,
  bookshelf: `I love to read since I'm a kid. I like to read books to learn things of course, but I also just like to read a 
              good novel.`,
