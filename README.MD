# Creatvie 2D portfolio type website

I took JSLegendDev's original idea and implied my own version of how a 2d portfolio could look like to it.

You can checkout a live demo at https://lenakujath.github.io/portfolio-play/.

The orignial tileset used was provided by [momen-games](https://momen-games.itch.io/happy-la-v2-ts).

## How to run

Note: You need `Node.js` and `npm` installed on your machine.

`npm install` then `npm run dev`

## How to build

`npm run build` and a dist folder should be created.

## How to preview the build

`npm run preview`

# How to host

I'm reffering you to the guide in JSLegendDev's repo: https://github.com/JSLegendDev/2d-portfolio-kaboom/blob/master/HOW_TO_DEPLOY.MD.
