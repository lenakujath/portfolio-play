# Creatvie 2D portfolio type website

I took [JSLegendDev](https://github.com/JSLegendDev)'s original idea and implied my own version of how a 2d portfolio could look like to it.

You can checkout a live demo at https://lenakujath.github.io/portfolio-play/.

The orignial tileset used was provided by [momen-games](https://momen-games.itch.io/happy-la-v2-ts).

## How to run

Note: You need `Node.js` and `npm` installed on your machine.

`npm install` then `npm run dev`

Use the `local` branch in this repo or manually set your vite configuration in `vite.config.js` as the following:

```
defineConfig({
    base: "/",
    ...
})
```

## How to build

`npm run build` and a dist folder should be created.

## How to preview the build

`npm run preview`

# How to host

I'm reffering you to the guide in JSLegendDev's repo: https://github.com/JSLegendDev/2d-portfolio-kaboom/blob/master/HOW_TO_DEPLOY.MD.
